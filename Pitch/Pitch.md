### Assets all over the place
I am a crypto enthusiast. I have traditional assets and digital ones stored on many different blockchains, but there's no easy way to see my full financial worth because most Wealth Management apps treat cryptocurrencies like second class citizens when displaying any cryptocurrency holding at all!

### Feels Unsafe
I don't want to keep the keys to my retirement on my phone or in a exchange. I also don't want to keep in a hardware wallet on my desk and lose my back up phrases. i want some one to store my most precious assets offline safe from hackers.
