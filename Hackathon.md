## Challenge Overview

### **WIPRO VIRTUAL HACKATHON**

The Wipro Virtual Hackathon is setting the stage for developers to build new applications to manage cryptocurrency portfolio and interact with cryptocurrency exchanges.

### **THEME OF THE HACKATHON**

Manage your cryptocurrency portfolio in a smart and automated way, leveraging the power of open APIs.

When we think of our finances and investment assets, one of the first things that come to our minds is how to manage them effectively. This is especially true for crypto assets because the price volatility is extremely high, the market is “up and running” 24/7 and there are hundreds of different assets available.

The Hackathon participants are tasked with leveraging API of Binance cryptocurrency exchange to develop tools, bots or applications that help to manage assets or track the cryptocurrency market.

Full documentation of the API can be found here: [https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#general-info](https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbinance-docs.github.io%2Fapidocs%2Fspot%2Fen%2F%23general-info&data=04%7C01%7Cjoe.stevens%40wipro.com%7C1fca7309558041e8dbec08d9af6c3717%7C258ac4e4146a411e9dc879a9e12fd6da%7C1%7C0%7C637733702809686744%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=Rr1%2FNjrOtmHe1Y%2BjUeS6Xhvvs3zFRtzhSLMN4OIKRK8%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#general-info.

##### **Examples of possible solutions:**

· A monitoring and alerting tool that is tracking the price of a cryptocurrency and sends notifications when the target price is hit

· A trading bot that based on predefined algorithm is actively trading on the market

· An application that displays the balance of the portfolio and calculates PNL, ROI, APY, etc.

· Or anything else, your imagination is the limit.

### **POTENTIAL FOR REAL LIFE APPLICATIONS:**

Even though the Hackathon is set in the cryptocurrency space, the rules and therefore solutions are easily transferable to the traditional banking space.

The same ideas could be applied successfully to manage FIAT portfolios or other traditional assets like stocks etc. Building robust monitoring tools and bots that can operate in extremely volatile market like cryptocurrency means this solution is also ready to scale in traditional banking space.

There is a certain level of abstraction here. This Hackathon is aiming towards demonstrating the power of open APIs and cloud computing as enabler of innovation.

##### **Things to remember:**

You can use a public cloud provider like AWS, GCP and Azure to host your idea on and provide working prototype and the required infrastructure.

_We will encourage you to use your personal accounts / laptops etc. for this work and avoid sharing any information from the Bank’s domain._

Whenever your code is in a working state, commit it. You never know when you may encounter a bug that you get stuck on. You can always roll back and submit an earlier working version. Sometimes, too, it can be easier to go back to a known working version and rewrite the code in a different way so as to avoid the bug.

Remember too, that your entry can address a smaller part of a bigger problem. The code component is meant to be a proof of concept. Make your entry as functional as possible, but if you need to, mock-up parts of other process flows - it is acceptable to demonstrate how your solution and its core components work.

### **SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS**

Upon completion of your Hackathon work, a link to the following deliverables should be submitted:

##### **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS**

· Code submission using a GitHub repository named after yourself / or your team.

· There should be one single Git repository for your submission. If external resources are required, an install/setup script should be included.

· All submission should include Docker or Vagrant container(s) that the solution runs on.

· Supporting documentation (this may include photographs of whiteboards, diagrams, written notes, a short business case, or any other material you think relevant)

· A 5-minute (or less) video summarising your entry – e.g. a screencast demonstration of your product and a short introduction to your team, vision, goals, and business proposition.

##### **OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

A working application and/or website.

###### **JUDGING CRITERIA**

· TECHNOLOGY - How technically impressive is the product? Does it use a particularly inventive technique, or does it use several different components? Does the product have a “wow” factor? How well does the project solve the prescribed problem?

· DESIGN - Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? Is it convincing, intuitive and consistent? Was the overall context of a solution considered? How relevant is the solution itself?

· MARKET FIT - Does the product solve a real problem and have a plausible market? Is there a workable business model that the project fits into? The project need not implement an entire business model.

· COMPLETION - Does the product work? Did the team achieve what they wanted?
