## What Is a Living Trust? 

A living trust is a legal document, or trust, created during an individual's lifetime where a designated person, the [trustee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trustee.asp), is given responsibility for managing that individual's assets for the benefit of the eventual beneficiary. A living trust is designed to allow for the easy transfer of the trust creator or settlor's assets while bypassing the often complex and expensive legal process of probate. Living trust agreements designate a trustee who holds legal possession of assets and property that flow into the trust.
