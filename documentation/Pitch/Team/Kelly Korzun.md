## Kelly Korzun 
 - reached out yesterday here seeking some assitence with setting up some kind of workshop to align my team and win this UBS/WIpro hackathon. 

- grasiously volunteered to help me and we were able to collaborate this morning and design a asyncronous workshop format that fits perfectly with the uniqueness of this project. 

- Not only that she helped align my thinking about the project so I can craft a story around it sure to win the Hackathon and demonstrate the value to UBS of cross functional collaboration, rapid prototyping and investign in high end talent.
