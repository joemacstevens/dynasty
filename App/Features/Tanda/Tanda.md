A **tanda** is a rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA) formed by a group of people who know one another for the purpose of helping each other save money for a larger goal, such as an interest-free loan or major purchase. The members of the group get together regularly to contribute an agreed-upon amount of money to a pool that is then given to one of the members.
