Problem: We all know that we should plan for our digital and traditional assets, but it's hard to get started. 

Agitate: Most people don't make a Legacy Plan because they think it will cost too much money or take too long. The average person can save over $1 million dollars in taxes by planning their estate correctly. This is very important and worth the time and money to do right!

Solution: Isan makes this easy by providing a simple interface on your phone where you can create your own customized Legacy Plan without paying an expensive lawyer thousands of dollars to do this for you. Our solution is free with no obligations required until after the first year when you decide if you would like us to continue managing your plans or not. If there are changes needed, just let us know what needs updating via email or text message from anywhere in the world at any time!
